# About me
My name is Hannah Brainard (she/her), and I'm a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Public Policy and Information Systems. 
I earned my bachelors degree in Arts Management from Indiana University, concentrating in music and performing arts. 

Currently the Chief Editor of Research for the [Arts Management and Technology Lab](https://amt-lab.org/), and my research interests lie at the intersection of climate, arts management, and innovation. This summer, I served as the Climate Engagement Intern at Phipps Conservatory, supporting the [Climate Toolkit](https://climatetoolkit.org/) for Museums, Gardens, and Zoos.
