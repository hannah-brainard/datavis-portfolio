# ABOUT ME
My name is Hannah Brainard (she/her), and I'm a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Public Policy and Information Systems. 
I earned my bachelors degree in Arts Management from Indiana University, concentrating in music and performing arts. 

Currently the Chief Editor of Research for the [Arts Management and Technology Lab](https://amt-lab.org/), and my research interests lie at the intersection of climate, arts management, and innovation. This summer, I served as the Climate Engagement Intern at Phipps Conservatory, supporting the [Climate Toolkit](https://climatetoolkit.org/) for Museums, Gardens, and Zoos. I plan to continue to working in climate research and consulting for the cultural sector - meeting a growing demand in the industry.

# WHAT I HOPE TO LEARN
Through this course, I hope to stengthen my data visualization and narrative building skills to support the arts and cultural industry better understand the current situation, report progress, and make a case for additional support. Toward this goal, key takeaways I'd like from this course include:

- Experiment with different data visualization tools and better evaluate which are best for certain functions. 
- The data may not always speak for itself. I'd like to learn how to better craft a compelling narrative to support a data story.
- Methods to design for the intended audience - including offering and receiving critique. 

# PORTFOLIO
See examples of my work, linked below. 

## Critique by Design
Inspired by [MakeoverMondayâ€™s](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) weekly series, I tried my hand at redesigning a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) chart about abundant levels of Greenhouse Gases in the atmosphere. [See the final product.](critique-by-design)

## Final project
How can museums invest their endowments in socially responsible funds? I explore this question in the data story. See the progression from idea to final product in Parts I - III below.
