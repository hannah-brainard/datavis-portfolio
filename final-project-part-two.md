# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for this story is a general museum professional, interested   though not necessarily a decision maker. I picture this type of content being shared through a channel like [The Climate Toolkit Network](https://climatetoolkit.org/) or conference, like the [Green Museum Summit](https://www.museumnext.com/events/green-museums-summit/). While these individuals would have a strong understanding of basic museum operations, they would work across departments (education, curatorial, events, marketing, among others). This topic centers around philanthropy and investment - topics that would be second nature development and finance professionals in a museum - but may require additional contextual information for a more general audience. A challenge in this story will be in providing the right amount of context, without overexplaining familiar concepts. Audience members are also not necessarily organizational leaders or decision-makers, so the call to action should be 

## Interview script
> Through my user research, I hope to learn more about how my target audience understands and responds to information as given. Primarily, I'd like to better understand what contextual information is needed to support the story, any what data points could better connect the story and support the call to action.  


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Context   | Does this provide the right amount of context to understand the topic? If too much, what can be cut. If too little, what additional information would support this story? |
| Flow      |  Does the content follow a logical flow? Does the narrative build on previous information? |
| Call to Action |  Do you feel that the call to action is reasonable? Does the piece provide the information you need to take this action? |
| Tone      |   How do you feel after reviewing this piece? Does the tone (written and visual) build encouragement to take the call to action? |
| Other     |  Is there anything else that causes confusion? Do you have any other suggestions for improving this story?  |

## Interview findings
With the above goals, I talked with two museum professionals, working in different disciplines relating to climate. I also talked with current Master of Public Policy Management student, who would have a strong understanding of environment and investing, but less about museums. 
 

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Public Policy Master's Student, ~20s) | Interview 2 (Museum - Climate Professional, ~30s)| Interview 3 (Museum - Youth Climate Action Professional, ~30s) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does this provide the right amount of context to understand the topic?  | Overall, right level of context. Didn't seem to overexplain the topic.| Could use more specific details about types of funds - beyond indexes, what projects does this support? Additional detail about ESG vs. socially responsible investments. Data visualizations were compelling. | Could use additional information about aternatives and where to find them.      |
| Does the content follow a logical flow? |  Follows good flow - with narrative and visuals. |      Order made sense.       |      Opening section hooked them and set up story well       |
| Do you feel that the call to action is reasonable? |  Reasonable call to action. |  Call to action is reasonable, could consider how to scale for different types of professionals. |  Could use additional details about specific opportunities, such as possible funds or where to find them.             |
| How do you feel after reviewing this piece? |  Postive - colors made a stong impact in this.                        | Felt inspired - didn't feel too much "doom and gloom." | Felt called to action, that there is a "huge upside to explore."  Good balance of    |
| Do you have any other comments or suggestions? |    Use of color was strong, drawing. Some spots could use increased text size to make easier to read.   |        Visually appealing and strong use of images. Could consider addtional information about organizations that have started to do this work (do some socially responsible investing, but not 100% divested), showing how to start or phase out. |  Could consider addressing "greenwashing," as it relates to ESG vs. impact investing, and caution to mislead audiences.  |

Overall, a few trends seemed to emerge. Visually, the story seemed to be impactful and representation of data conveyed the key ideas. There seemed to be a lot of interest in the topic, and generally, the amount of contextual information was on track. A couple addtional details could help connect the story - specifically in framing what social impact funds are in a more tangible way, and what options are available. If I can find strong, available data on these topics, these would make strong data visualizations. During each of these interviews, I was also able to live correct minor language that was vague or unclear. 
 
# Identified changes for Part III  

For the final phase of the project, key changes center around finding and visualizing key data points to bridge areas of the story. As identified in the user interviews, these steps may support a stronger emotional appeal for the viewer, and provide them with stonger background to be able to take action. I will make minor changes to improve the viasability of existing graphs, but otherwise anticipate making few changes. 


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Additional detail on what sustainable investing supports | Visualize types of projects supported through sustainable investing, quantify impact in relation to dollars invested. A pictoral graph (Ex. Number of Windmills, etc.) This will be determined through the availability of data. If I cannot find a reliable dataset, this may also be accomplished through additional photographs and prose descriptions. |
| Provide details on aternatives, where to look for information |  Show top Carbon 200 Underground indexes, juxtaposed with top sustainable indexes. This can be visualized in a dot plot, identified by color. Labels will identify names of index, so user can find more information independently. Additionally, in the call to action, I will add link buttons to learn more.  |                                                                                |
| Show more of how organizations are doing this work to support the call to action. | Add 1-2 more sample cases of museums already doing with socially responsible investing, utilize table to compare key figures from each institution. |
| Embed Tableau visualizations to be dynamic with | To address some of the trouble reading text on graphs, embed visualizations within Shorthand with clear labels so they are easier to hover over and read. |
