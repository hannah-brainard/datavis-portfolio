# Critique By Design
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

This visualization was selected from [MakeoverMonday's](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) weekly series, which encourages people to hone their data visualization skills through redesign. This particular piece was of interest to me, due to its

## Step two: the critique
The data visualization is useful, though only in telling a fairly limited story. It takes a little bit of digging to see exactly what the charts are showing - you see that it’s a level of these Greenhouses gases, but it’s not immediately clear if this is showing emissions for a specific country or region, levels in the atmosphere, etc. 

A clear title describing what the audience should take away would improve this. After reading the description, I discovered that it shows global greenhouse gas abundance for Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous Oxide, Methane, and other gases. From these charts, it’s easy to see in general, they each increase over time. However, it is extremely difficult to compare trends between gases, as each has an extremely different scale (parts per million vs. billion vs. trillion). If each chart was isolated, this scaling may be useful to make data points clear and visible and wouldn’t cause much concern. However, by displaying them together in this, this is likely to mislead the viewer to believe that these gases exist at a similar level. In terms of color, there are a number of opportunities to enhance the visualization.  the same color is used across the four charts to represent different gases, which could also lead to confusion in interpreting that chart. Aesthetically, this visualization does not effectively attract or engage more attention. could be improved by reducing alignment points. 


## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions for critique:

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

A couple key themes emerged from this feedback. First, that there is opportunity to more clearly articlulate one key story from this visualization. While respondants saw value in this type of chart in showing proportion and changes over time, it was difficult to get a clear understanding of how the differences in proportion change. This is a known risk of using stacked area graphs, but there are additional design elements that might better.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
