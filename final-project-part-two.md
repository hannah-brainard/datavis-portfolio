# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for this story is a general museum professional, interested   though not necessarily a decision maker. I picture this type of content being shared through a channel like [The Climate Toolkit Network](https://climatetoolkit.org/) or conference, like the [Green Museum Summit](https://www.museumnext.com/events/green-museums-summit/). While these individuals would have a strong understanding of basic museum operations, they would work across departments (education, curatorial, events, marketing, among others). This topic centers around philanthropy and investment - topics that would be second nature development and finance professionals in a museum - but may require additional contextual information for a more general audience. A challenge in this story will be in providing the right amount of context, without overexplaining familiar concepts. Audience members are also not necessarily organizational leaders or decision-makers, so the call to action should be 

## Interview script
> Through my user research, I hope to learn more about how my target audience interprets the information as given. Primarily, I'd like to better understand what contextual information could support the story, guaging if some topics are over explained. 


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Context   | Does this provide the right amount of context to understand the topic? If too much, what can be cut. If too little, what additional information would support this story? |
| Flow      |  Does the content follow a logical flow? Does the narrative build on previous information? |
| Call to Action |  Do you feel that the call to action is reasonable? Does the piece provide the information you need to take this action? |
| Tone      |   How do you feel after reviewing this piece? Does the tone (written and visual) build encouragement to take the call to action? |
| Other     |  Is there anything else that causes confusion? Do you have any other suggestions for improving this story?  |

## Interview findings
With the above goals, I talked with two museum professionals, working in different disciplines. I also talked with current Master of Public Policy Management student, who would have a strong understanding of environment and investing, but less about museums. 
 

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Public Policy Master's Student) | Interview 2 (Museum - Climate Professional)| Interview 3 (Museum - Climate Professional) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does this provide the right amount of context to understand the topic?  | Overall, right level of context. Didn't seem to overexplain the topic.| Could use more specific details about types of funds - beyond indexes, what projects does this support? Additional detail about ESG vs. socially responsible investments. Data visualizations were compelling. | Could use additional information about aternatives and where to find them.      |
| Does the content follow a logical flow? |  Follows good flow - with narrative and visuals. |      Order made sense.       |      Opening section hooked them and set up story well       |
| Do you feel that the call to action is reasonable? |  Reasonable call to action. |  Call to action is reasonable, could consider how to scale for different types of professionals. |  Could use additional details about specific opportunities, such as possible funds or where to find them.             |
| How do you feel after reviewing this piece? |  Postive - colors made a stong impact in this.                        | Felt inspired - didn't feel too much "doom and gloom." | Felt called to action, that there is a "huge upside to explore."  Good balance of    |
| Do you have any other comments or suggestions? |    Use of color was strong, drawing. Some spots could use increased text size to make easier to read.   |        Visually appealing and strong use of images. Could consider addtional information about organizations that have started to do this work (do some socially responsible investing, but not 100% divested), showing how to start or phase out. |  Could consider addressing "greenwashing," as it relates to ESG vs. impact investing, and caution to mislead audiences.  |

Overall, a few trends seemed to emerge. Visually, the story seemed to be impactful and representation of data conveyed the key ideas. There seemed to be a lot of interest in the topic, and generally, the amount of contextual information was on track. A couple addtional details could help connect the story - specifically in framing what social impact funds are in a more tangible way, and what options are available. If I can find strong, available data on these topics, these would make strong data visualizations. During each of these interviews, I was also able to live correct minor language that was vague or unclear.
