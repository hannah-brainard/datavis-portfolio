# Outline
Collectively, U.S. museums hold more than $60 billion in endowment funds (Upstart CoLab, 2022). With growing public attention to ethical considerations around,   Beyond making a statement of values, responsible investing can be one of the most impactful ways for museums to take social and environmental action. 

The idea for this project centers around understanding the scale of endowment funds, and   Ideally, this information will help museum administrators be more informed about the 

Institutions are not generally open about the specifics of their investment portfolio. Through this project, I want to use existing data about the scale of museum endowments, paired with accessible data about trends in sustainable and socially responsible investing. To support the narrative, I will use case studies from institutions who have transitioned their investments to socially responsible funds successfully.

### Project Structure

**1. Intro.** Divest” has seemingly become a charged term, but it’s really an opportunity for museums to align their financial strategy with their values. One of the most prominent ways museums can do this is through investment of endowment funds. 

**2. Role of Endowments.**  Endowments permanently designate contributed funds for investment, which help fund operations through interest awarded. 

**3. Set the scale.** In the United States alone, museums hold more than an estimated $50 billion in endowments - trailing behind education and foundations (Ali, 2023). Chart 1: Scale of these endowments, by industry.

**4. Top 10.** TThe top museum endowments in the U.S. the Metropolitan Museum of Art and J. Paul Getty Trust (Ali, 2023). Chart 2: 5 Largest U.S. Museum endowments - pull out “museums” from the previous chart and visualize top museums in a parallel format.

**5. Potential Impact.**  Using the average, scale what this would mean in terms of an environmental or social development - for example, acreage of wind energy or associated energy generated. Chart 3: Pictograph showing quantity of potential impact, relative to average endowment size. 

**6. Why not?** Considering the fiduciary responsibility of the board, there is often hesitation around changing the funding strategy. A study by Deutsche Bank shows that investors feel ESG investments are generally at pace, and even outperforming, standard investments. Chart 4: Horizontal stacked bar shows “neither outperformed now underperformed” and “outperformed.”

**7. Success Stories.** However, many are divesting from fossil fuels all together, and committing to socially responsible investments. Examples from the industry include:   

  -  Example 1: The Field Museum - Chicago
  -  Example 2: American Museum of Natural History
  -  Example 3: Museum of Modern Art

**8. Call to Action.** Learn how your museum is investing endowment funds, and advocate to leadership for transitioning to a more sustainable strategy.

# The data

I will acquire data about individual museums from their financial statements to craft a data table, to input into Tableau. To look at larger trends, I'm using data from Deutsche Bank, but limited to the United States. This section will likely be supplemented with additional data, as I continue to find relevant publicly available data.
