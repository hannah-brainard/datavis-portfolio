# The final data story
 See my final data story on Shorthand: [https://preview.shorthand.com/QJknJoMJ4nzXc1wG ](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/museumsinvestingreenfuture/index.html)

## Changes made since Part II
There is a lot of different language used around socially responsible investing - impact investing, ethical investing, green investing. One key theme that emerged through my user interviews was to provide additional context for some of these terms - and particularly, to further distinguish between "ESG investments" and "impact investing" and how they relate to one another. I did this primarily through additional narrative description, as well as an additional visualization showing top ESG companies.
 
Additionally, there was some confusion about the data point that "1/3 of museums reported allocating their endowment portfolio to socially responsible investments." I found myself needing to verbally explain that this did not mean that 1/3 of endowment funds were invested in socially responsible funds - rather, that 1/3 of museums reported allocation of any portion of their endowment funds. The updated verbiage and visualization seems to better communicate this point.

I had previously hoped to provide additional case studies at the conclusion of this story, because this was an area the target audience members in my user research seemed really drawn to. Users stated that they were interested in knowing more about institutions that have started to make socially responsible investments, but maybe haven't fully divested fossil fuels. However, limitations in relevant data from institutions who have reported transitioning to responsible investing made this fairly obsolete. 

Another area of focus was in the call to action. I had previously struggled with focusing this message on the audience and making it realistic to implement. As I returned to this section to update after Part II, I wanted to keep this section concise so it could be memorable and low-barrier. However, I also wanted to make sure the audience had the right amount of information to take action. 

With the audience in mind (as detailed below), I focused this section on what realistic next steps would be for a typical museum professional: learning more about their institution and sharing this with decision makers. Not every individual in this audience would be the right one to start contacting their financial advisor or evaluating funds against sustainability criteria. However, anyone could "start the conversation" - asking questions internally or sharing what they learned with a colleague. I added a button at the bottom, allowing the viewer to share the presentation via email in just a couple of clicks. 

## The audience
The audience I had in mind while crafting this story is a general museum professional with an interest in pursuing environmental sustainability in their institution.

In museums, and cultural organizations more generally, there is growing awareness about their institutional role in addressing global climate change - both in the operations of their facilities and the subject of their programming. A number of climate-focused professional networks and conferences have been established to provide museum professionals with resources to make changes within their institutions - such as [The Climate Toolkit Network](https://climatetoolkit.org/?), [Gallery Climate Coalition](https://galleryclimatecoalition.org/), [Green Museums Summit](https://www.museumnext.com/events/green-museums-summit/), [Ki Culture](https://www.kiculture.org/), among others. I see this being shared through a channel similar to these. 

The representatives that interface with these networks can vary by institution, and involvement is determined as much by individual interest as it is by specific job requirements. Museums rarely have a dedicated sustainability professional on staff, and more often, a variety of staff members working in different roles across the institution form a "green team" or informally volunteer to tackle sustainability initiatives. With this in mind, the kinds of audience members that might interact with a piece like this would likely have a strong understanding of general museum work and an interest in better understanding opportunities to enhance sustainability initiatives. This wouldn't necessarily be an executive, it could be someone in education, curation, fundraising, marketing, visitor services, facility management, or a number of other departments.

By nature of these types of networks, professionals would also likley span museum disciplines - including art, natural history, science center, zoos, botanical gardens, aquaria. With this in mind, I wanted to ensure that the content was specifically tailored to the museum field, but broadly applicable across museums types.

To better understand how my potential audience might interact with the piece, I did user research in Phase II with two museum professionals, currently working both for a museum and in support of a climate-focused professional network. These interviews really helped my guage the level of information that would be appropriate to be meaningful for a varied audience - without overexplaining familiar ideas. This also helped me refine my call to action be more actionable for the intended audience.  

## Final design decisions
Two areas of design I want to highlight in my final design are color and use of visualizations: 

**Color:** I used one shade of green throughout the presentation for text, data visualizations, and images drew out some of the same colors. Admittedly, I'm always hesitant to default to green when talking about climate, as it can be overused and a bit deceptive. However, this really seemed to resonate with the audience. Throughout user research, this was quickly recognized to 

**Visualizations:** I opted to use fairly simple chart types, with generally one key focus per chart. Combined with color and a descriptive title, users seemed to understand the key point quickly. 

Overall, Shorthand made it simple to pull this content together cohesively. I had a couple small obstacles using the tool, including minor limitations in customizing built-in elements and impropering sizing of irregularly shaped embedded charts. 


## Final thoughts
Overall, this process provided a really great opportunity to dive into a topic that was interesting to me. Last summer, I interned with the Climate Toolkit Network at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. As part of my internship, I started to analyze trends in how organizations were pledging to various climate goals. I was surprised to see that divesting fossil fuels/socially responsible investment had the lowest commitment rate of any climate goal - even lower than goals relating to major capital improvement. When I shared this finding with organizational leadership, they chuckled and shared that they weren't surprised at all. While I initially thought it sounded like an easy switch, they described just how difficult it can be to convince a board of directors to change investment strategy when the financial stakes are so high. This made me want to learn more about the structural barriers to socially responsible investing and how to make the case for support to organizational leaders. Having this specific audience and goal in mind really helped in crafting this data story.

With this in mind, I had hoped to paint a clearer picture of impact and quantify specific environmental outcomes. In practice, this can be very tricky - with so many variable factors, you can't definitively say that investing $1 million in a solar energy company would result in "X" acres of new solar development or "X" kWh of energy. To do this successfully would have required a level of financial acumen far exceeding my skillset. Instead, I focused on better describing the types of funds or projects that could be considered.

Ultimately, this issue continues to be extremely complex and there are infinitely many ways that an organization could approach it. Outside of mandatory tax documentation, museums are very private about their endowment funds. With more time and available data, I would want to take a deeper dive about specific opportunities and outcomes. Overall, I think this data story has successfully "scratched the surface," and I feel optimistic about the response it had from my target audience. 

## Final presentation script: 

"As museum professionals, we’re paying increasing attention to the role our institutions play in addressing global climate change - and one of the most overlooked areas of impact is responsible investment of endowment funds. 

To set the scale: museums in the U.S. collectively hold an estimated $64 billion in their endowments, with 7 individual institutions holding more than $1 billion. These funds are restricted in perpetuity for the purpose of investment. 

However, only about ⅓ of museums report allocating any portion of their endowment portfolio to socially responsible funds.

Most commonly, this is through index funds that meet certain sustainability criteria - like ESG standards. 

Many institutions hesitate to make change out of concern that this could negatively impact their financial position. But - its worth noting that since 2021, S&P 500’s ESG Index has consistently outpaced its standard index. 

And - a number of museums successfully made the switch. 

So, I challenge you to start the conversation. 

Share this information with your information with your board and senior leadership. Learn more about where your endowment funds are going, and advocate for change at your institution."
