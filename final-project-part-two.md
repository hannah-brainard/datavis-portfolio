# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for this story is a general museum professional, interested   though not necessarily a decision maker. I picture this type of content being shared through a channel like [The Climate Toolkit Network](https://climatetoolkit.org/) or conference, like the [Green Museum Summit](https://www.museumnext.com/events/green-museums-summit/). While these individuals would have a strong understanding of basic museum operations, they would work across departments (education, curatorial, events, marketing, among others). This topic centers around philanthropy and investment - topics that would be second nature development and finance professionals in a museum - but may require additional contextual information for a more general audience. A challenge in this story will be in providing the right amount of context, without overexplaining familiar concepts. Audience members are also not necessarily organizational leaders or decision-makers, so the call to action should be

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Public Policy Master's Student) | Interview 2 (Museum - Climate Professional)| Interview 3 (Museum - Climate Professional) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does this provide the right amount of context to understand the topic?  | Overall, right level of context. Didn't seem to overexplain the topic.| Could use more specific details about types of funds - beyond indexes, what projects does this support? | Could usse additional information about aternatives and where to find them. Opening section hooked them and set up story well.      |
| Does the content follow a logical flow? |  Follows good flow - with narrative and visuals. |             |             |
| Do you feel that the call to action is reasonable? |  Reasonable call to action. |  Call to action is reasonable, could consider how to scale for different types of professionals. |  Could use additional details about specific opportunities, such as possible funds or where to find them.             |
| How do you feel after reviewing this piece? |                                | Felt inspired - didn't feel too much "doom and gloom." | Felt called to action, that there is a "huge upside to explore."  Good balance of    |
| Do you have any other comments or suggestions? |    Use of color was strong, drawing. Some spots could use increased text size to make easier to read.   |        Visually appealing and strong use of images. Could consider addtional information about organizations that have started to do this work (do some socially responsible investing, but not 100% divested) to show action. |  Could consider addressing "greenwashing," as it relates to ESG vs. impact investing, and caution to mislead audiences.  |
