# Changes made since Part II

Theres is a lot of different language used around socially responsible investing - impact investing, ethical investing, green investing - as well. One key theme that emerged through my user interviews was to provide additional context for some of these terms 0- and particularly, to further distinguish between "socially responsible investing" and "ESG investments" and how they relate to one another. I did this primarily through additional narrative description 

Additionally, there was some confusion about the data point that "1/3 of museums reported allocating their endowment portfolio to socially responsible investments." I found myself needing to verbally explain that this did not mean that 1/3 of endowmentfunds were invested in socially responsible funds - rather, that 1/3 of museums reported allocation any portion of their endowment 

I added two additional case studies at the conclusion, because this was an area the audience seemed really drawn to. Users stated that they were interested in knowing more about institutions that have started to make socially responsible investments, but maybe haven't fully divested fossil fuels. 

Another area of focus was in the call to action. I 

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The audience I had in mind while craftng this story is a general museum professional. In museums, and arts and cultural organizations more generally, there is growing awareness about the role these institutions play in addressing global climate change - both in how their facility operations A numner of professional networks and tagerted conferences have been establishied to provide museum professionals with resources to make changes within their institutions. Sometimes, museums have a staff memeber dedicated to their sustainability work, but more often, a variety of professionals working in different roles across the instution step up to consider sustainability through own work. This wouldn't necessarily be the Executive Director or other decision maker - in many cases this would be an education, curation, fundraising, marketing, visitor services, facility management, or a number of other departments. 

As such, the kinds of audiences that might interact with a piece like this through channels like The Climate Toolkit Network, Gallery Climate Coalition, Green Museum Summit, or similar would likely have a strong understanding of general museum work and an interest in better understanding opportunities to enhance sustainability initiatives.

By nature of these types of networks, professionals would also likley span museum disciplines - including art, natural history, science center, zoos, botanical gardens, aquaria, and more. With this in mind, I wanted to ensure that the content was broadly applicable across museums types, but very specific on an operational aspect that would impact all of these institutions. 

To better understand how my potential audience might interact with the piece, I did user research in Phase 2 with two museum professionals, currently working both for a museum and in support of a climate-focused professional network. These interviews really helped my guage the level of information that would be appropriate to be meaningful for a varied audience - without overexplaining ideas that would be familiar.
